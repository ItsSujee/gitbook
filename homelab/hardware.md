## Server 1: Lenovo ThinkCentre M710Q Tiny

My servers live in an IKEA MICKE desk and need to be small while still packing a solid punch.

Yes I know overheating will become a problem with a server living inside a desk. However, there is ample air flow out the back of the desk so I'm not worried about it.
